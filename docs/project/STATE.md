# Current Project State

**Last updated:** 2026-09-18  
**Repository:** `asdzxc1a/Ai-agent`  
**Phase:** Browser foundation  
**Current gate:** Gate 1 — Steel alone, local  
**Overall status:** Gate 0 is merged and closed. Gate 1 is in progress on branch `gate-1-steel-local`, tracked by issue #21.

## North star

Build the smallest reliable TinyFish-like browser-agent platform first:

```text
Our API
  ↓
Our durable run engine
  ↓
Stagehand
  ↓ CDP
Steel
  ↓
Chromium
```

Only after that path is reliable:

```text
Stagehand
  ↓ CDP
Steel inside E2B sandbox
  ↓
Chromium
```

## What is already decided

- Use this repository as the working home because it was effectively empty.
- TypeScript-first initially.
- Do not merge/fork Stagehand, Steel, and E2B into one codebase.
- Integrate them through our own small interfaces.
- Prove Stagehand→Steel locally before adding E2B.
- Build one gate at a time.
- Tests are the evidence for progress.
- Keep durable project memory in GitHub, not in chat.
- A fresh Astra starts with `AGENTS.md` and this file.

## What has been built

Foundation code now exists: a minimal TypeScript/pnpm workspace plus the initial `@astra/contracts` package and run-status unit test.

Project-memory system:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/project/CHARTER.md`
- `docs/project/STATE.md`
- `docs/project/PLAN.md`
- `docs/project/DECISIONS.md`
- `docs/project/LESSONS.md`
- `docs/project/TEST_STRATEGY.md`
- `docs/project/HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md`
- GitHub PR template

## What has been tested

Gate 0 evidence: PR #19 merged after PR-triggered GitHub Actions run `35375643603` passed install, lint, typecheck, unit tests, and build with the committed lockfile.

Memory bootstrap verification: required files were created and fetched successfully from GitHub; the bootstrap change is recorded in PR #15.

## Known risks

1. Upstream Stagehand/Steel/E2B APIs will evolve; adapters must isolate that churn.
2. Live-web tests are inherently flaky; local deterministic fixture sites must be the main development benchmark.
3. Adding E2B too early would multiply complexity.
4. Forking upstreams too early would create unnecessary maintenance burden.
5. Documentation can become stale if the PR process does not require state updates.

## Next action

**Gate 1 / issue #21:** pin an immutable Steel Docker image, add one deterministic fixture, then prove Steel session create → CDP connect → navigate → click → verify → screenshot → release succeeds 10/10 in CI.

## Gate completion rule

The current gate is complete only when its acceptance tests in `PLAN.md` and `TEST_STRATEGY.md` pass and this file has been updated with the evidence.

## Latest durable lesson

Start simple: **local Stagehand→Steel first; E2B later.**
